.TH MONSTERWM 1 monsterwm
.SH NAME
monsterwm \- minimal and dynamic tiling window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B monsterwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I monsterwm
is a minimal, lightweight, tiny but monstrous, dynamic tiling window manager.
.P
.SH MODES
.I monsterwm
comes with four tiling layouts by default plus the floating mode.
It allows the usual method of tiling window managers, with the new window as
the master window, but also provides the ability to have the new window opened
as the last window (at the bottom) of the stack.
.P
the available modes:
.TP
.B Tile stack
the stack clients are tiled on the side of master.
.TP
.B Bottom stack
the stack clients are tiled beneath the master.
.TP
.B Grid mode
clients are tiled in a grid, equally sharing and dividing the screen space
.TP
.B Monocle mode
also known as max mode, where the clients take up the entire
screen space. Other clients are hidden behind the current shown window.
On this layout, maximized clients don't need and don't have borders.
You can change that behavior with the
.I monocleborders
patch, in the corresponding branch. The state of the panel is preserved.

.TP
.B Floating mode
windows can move and be resized freely in the screen space, like on a stacking
window manager. Windows retain their floating status until the user switches
to a tiling mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
prints version information to standard output, then exits.
.SH USAGE
.SS Status bar
.P
.I monsterwm
does not provide a status bar. Consistent with the Unix philosophy,
.I monsterwm
provides information to the status bar or panel of choice via outputting
text with information about the state of the windows.
.P
the available settings in
.I config.h
for the panel/status bar, are:
.TP
.B SHOW_PANEL
whether the panel should be visible or hidden by default
.TP
.B TOP_PANEL
whether the panel should be on top or bottom of the screen
.TP
.B PANEL_HEIGHT
how much space should be left for use by the panel. Set to
.B 0
to disable the panel completely.
